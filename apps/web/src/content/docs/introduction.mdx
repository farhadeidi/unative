## What is Unative?

Unative makes it easy to create great-looking and consistent user interfaces for both React Native and web apps. Powered by Tailwind CSS and Nativewind, it gives you a fast and simple way to handle styling across platforms. With full support for React Server Components, Unative helps you use modern tools to build amazing projects effortlessly.

### The Story Behind

As someone who has been working as a Frontend Developer for years, I’ve always noticed a significant gap between UI libraries for web and mobile. I needed a UI library that was fully optimized for both platforms—a library that I could use seamlessly on the web (without requiring any extra layers like `react-native-web`) and on mobile without being restricted by React Native’s limitations for web elements.

Most importantly, I wanted something that could stay in sync across all my projects, ensuring consistency and efficiency in my workflow.

### Learn once, Use everywhere

The **Unative** UI Library is inspired by ShadCN, with additional support from [RNR](https://github.com/mrzachnugent/react-native-reusables) and **RN-Primitives**. It is designed to work seamlessly across both web and mobile platforms, offering a truly native experience.

**Unative does not require react-native-web in nextjs or other web frameworks.** No components from React Native will be loaded in your web projects, even when using frameworks like Next.js, Vite, or any other React-based framework. This means you get an optimized, fully native experience for web and mobile without relying on compatibility layers or workarounds.

Whether you're building a mobile app or a web project, Unative provides a single, unified library that ensures consistency, performance, and simplicity across platforms.

## Optimized for Both Platforms

Unative is fully optimized for both web and mobile platforms. Everything is loaded in a completely treeshakeable way. For example, if you only use the `Box` component on the web, the size of the import is as minimal as importing a simple `<div>`. On React Native, it’s equivalent to importing a `View` from `react-native`.

All components are processed individually, ensuring maximum efficiency. Each core component consists of two main files:

- **web**: Includes all dependencies required for running on the web, powered by [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/).
- **native**: Includes all dependencies for running on React Native and React Native Web.

This modular approach ensures that your projects remain lightweight and optimized, regardless of the platform you’re building for.

```tsx title="./src/my-card.tsx"
// The only file you need
// Nextjs, React Native, React Native Web, Expo and ...

import { cn } from "unative/lib/utils";
import type { BoxProps } from "unative/ui/box";
import { Box } from "unative/ui/box";
import {
  Card,
  CardContent,
  CardDescription,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
} from "unative/ui/card";
import { Text } from "unative/ui/text";

export type MyCardProps = BoxProps & {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  content: string;
};

export const MyCard = ({
  title,
  content,
  className,
  ...props
}: MyCardProps) => {
  return (
    <Card className={cn("flex", className)} {...props}>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{title}</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>My Description</CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <Box>
          <Text>{content}</Text>
        </Box>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

## Example Project

For a complete example of how to use **Unative** with Expo, check out the [Unative Expo example](https://github.com/farhadeidi/unative-expo-example) project. It demonstrates how to set up Unative with Expo Router, Nativewind, TypeScript, and more.
